                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                    This is a card game based on superbikes.<hr> 
                    Each bike card will have four attributes consistent of Power, Torque, 0-100km/h time and Max RPM.<hr> 
                    By clicking one of these stats your card will be compared to the Computer card.<hr> 
                    Whoever has the better performing stat will be granted a scorer point.
                    After comparing you need to draft the next card of your staple to get the next round started.<hr>
                    This match is a best of five. Whoever reaches three scorer points first will win the game.<hr>
                    You can start the game after you entered your player name and by pressing the Start Game Button below.<hr>
                    Best of luck and most importantly - have fun!
