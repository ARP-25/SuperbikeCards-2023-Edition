                    This is a Card Game based on Superbikes.<hr> 
                    Each Bike Card will have four Attributes consistent of Power, Torque, 0-100km/h time and Max RPM.<hr> 
                    By clicking one of these stats your card will be compared to the Computer card.<hr> 
                    Whoever has the better performing stat will be granted a scorer point.
                    After comparing you need to draft the next Card of your staple to start the next round.<hr>
                    This match is a best of five. Whoever reaches three scorer points first will win the game.<hr>
                    You can start the game after you entered your Player Name and by pressing the Start Game Button below.<hr>
                    Best of luck and have fun!
