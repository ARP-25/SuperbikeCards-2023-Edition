## Design

-   ### Imagery
    -   The card pictures are all realistically representing the associated card specs which are both not fictional.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  The color Scheme is adjusted to mainly provide good contrast and readability still offering an appealing design and fit the theme of superbikes.
    -  The specific areas have the background-color: "rgb(51,51,51)". Which is a dark gray similar to asphalt.
    -  For logo and certain elements "#FFA500" and "aqua" were used. These two provide a modern, race sport and game oriented look.
    -  Font Color is adjusted through the game to give good contrast to specific background-color.

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts was used to import font into styles.css. Orbitron and Bangers were chosen to introduce a dynamic contrast. Orbitron represents sleek futuristic technology, focusing on precision and speed, while Bangers bring a gritty, rebellious vibe with raw power and aggression. This choice adds diversity, balance, and engaging gameplay to the experience, appealing to a wide range of players.
